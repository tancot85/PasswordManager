## PASSWORD MANAGER
A tkinter based application to manage online credentials. These passwords are stored in an encrypted database and locked behind a master password. 


## TECH STACK USED
* **Tkinter**: used to create the Graphical User interface(GUI) of the application
* **Firebase**: The backend. Stores all the passwords
* **Fernet module of the cryptography package**: encrypt and decrypt passwords


## WHAT ARE WE USING TO HASH PASSWORDS?
* **SHA256**: We use SHA-256 because this 256-bit key is much more secure than other common hashing algorithms. Collisions are incredibly unlikely. There are 2256 possible hash values when using SHA-256, which makes it nearly impossible for two different documents to coincidentally have the exact same hash value.
